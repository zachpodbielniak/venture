name: venturectl
description: Drive a VENTURE server from the command line — read, create, update, delete and restore any record type, run reports, and configure the git-forge integration. Use whenever the task involves a VENTURE instance, its data (sales, expenses, invoices, tickets, contacts, ledger), or its forge/AI-agent setup. Also trigger on "venturectl", "VENTURE server", or a request to query or change records in VENTURE.

# venturectl

`venturectl` is VENTURE's command-line client. It talks to a running server
over HTTP and never opens the database: one writer, one set of validation
rules, one audit trail.

Everything it does is generic over record types. There is no `venturectl
sale` subcommand and there never will be — the type is an argument, so a
record type added yesterday already works.

## Before anything else

```bash
export VENTURE_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:8747     # default; omit if it matches
export VENTURE_TOKEN=vk_...                     # or pass --token
venturectl health
```

Mint a token from the UI (Settings → API tokens) or
`POST /api/v1/tokens` as an admin. It is shown once.

If `health` fails, stop and fix that. Every other command will fail the same
way and less clearly.

## The one habit that prevents most mistakes

**Run `describe` before you write.** It prints every field in the spelling
you must type, what each reference points at, what each enum accepts, and
what the field is for:

```bash
venturectl describe forge_rule
```

```
forge_rule (table forge_rules)

  name                       string     required
                             What this rule is for
  repo_id                    reference  -> forge_repo
                             Leave empty for a forge-wide rule
  issue_type                 enum       [task|subtask|story|epic|bug|research]
  all_issue_types            boolean
                             Ignore the issue type and apply to every ticket in scope
```

Guessing a field name costs a silent no-op. Reading it costs one command.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `types` | every record type |
| `describe TYPE` | fields, references, enum choices, help text |
| `list TYPE [filters]` | records, filtered and paged |
| `get TYPE ID` | one record |
| `create TYPE field=value ...` | a new record |
| `update TYPE ID field=value ...` | change a record |
| `delete TYPE ID` | soft delete — the row stays, stamped |
| `restore TYPE ID` | clear that stamp |
| `forge set-token ID` | set a forge's access token, read from stdin |
| `forge set-secret ID` | set or generate its webhook secret |
| `forge verify ID` | record which account the token belongs to |
| `report [NAME] [PERIOD]` | list reports, or run one |
| `health` | is the server up |

Flags: `--server/-s`, `--token/-t`, `--format/-f table|json|yaml`,
`--quiet/-q`.

## Five traps, in the order they bite

**1. Field names use underscores on the wire.** Properties are `forge-id`
inside VENTURE and `forge_id` when you type them. `describe` prints the
typed spelling, so copy from there. A dashed key is ignored field by field:
the record saves and the value simply is not there.

**2. Filters are `field__operator=value`.**

```bash
venturectl list ticket issue_type__eq=bug status__ne=done
venturectl list expense amount__gte=100 occurred_at__gte=2026-01-01
venturectl list contact name__ilike=smith
```

Operators: `eq ne lt lte gt gte like ilike in not_in is_null not_null
between`. Bare `field=value` also works as equality.

`limit`, `offset`, `page`, `search`, `order` and `include_deleted` are
reserved and are *not* field filters. Anything else must be a real field or
the request is refused — with the available fields listed, which is usually
the fastest way to find the name you wanted.

**3. References are ids, so look the id up first.**

```bash
REPO=$(venturectl -f json list forge_repo name__eq=zach/venture \
        | jq -r '.records[0].id')
venturectl create ticket title="It crashes" issue_type=bug repo_id="$REPO"
```

**4. Enums are their nick, never a number.** `issue_type=bug`, not
`issue_type=4`. `describe` lists them.

**5. Money is written plainly and read back structured.** Send
`amount=12.34`; you get `{"amount": 1234, "currency": "USD", "exponent": 2,
"formatted": "12.34 USD"}`. It is integer minor units, never a float. Use
`.formatted` for display and `.amount` for arithmetic.

## What it cannot do, by design

**Sensitive fields are never accepted from a payload.** A forge access
token, a webhook secret, a password hash — naming one in `create` or
`update` is ignored, not an error, and the rest of the payload still
applies.

Each credential has its own way of being set correctly, which is why there
is no generic "write this sensitive field" command: a password must be
hashed, a forge token must not be, and one command for both would be a way
to get one of them wrong.

For a forge, use the `forge` subcommand — the one part of `venturectl` that
is not generic over types, and the exception earns itself:

```bash
printf '%s' "$FORGE_TOKEN" | venturectl forge set-token 1
venturectl forge set-token 1 < token.txt

printf '' | venturectl forge set-secret 1    # generates one, returns it once
printf '%s' "$SECRET" | venturectl forge set-secret 1

venturectl forge verify 1                    # records the bot account
```

**The value comes from standard input, and there is no flag to put it in
argv.** A command line is visible to every process on the host through
`/proc` and lands in shell history; a secret that has been in either has to
be rotated. An empty token is refused rather than treated as "leave it
alone" — a script that sent an empty string meant to send something and its
variable was unset.

`forge verify` is not optional if you want webhooks: it records which
account the token belongs to, and that is the loop guard. Without it VENTURE
cannot tell an issue it filed itself from one somebody else opened.

A user's password still has no CLI path and is set on the account page.
Setting a hash directly is what hashing exists to prevent.

**Audit entries and run records refuse writes entirely**, for everybody.
They are the record of what happened.

**Some types need more than an editor.** `forge` is owner-only, `forge_rule`
and `plugin_config` are admin-only, `user` and `api_token` are owner-only. A
403 here means the token's role, not a bug.

## Worked example: wire up a forge

```bash
# 1. The server, and where git lives — often a different host
venturectl create forge name="Home" kind=forgejo \
    base_url=https://git.example.com \
    clone_base_url=git@git-ssh.example.com \
    active=true

# 2. The credentials, from a script
FORGE=$(venturectl -f json list forge name__eq=Home | jq -r '.records[0].id')
printf '%s' "$FORGE_TOKEN" | venturectl forge set-token "$FORGE"
venturectl forge verify "$FORGE"

# Generate a webhook secret and keep it — it is shown once, and you paste
# it into the forge's webhook settings.
SECRET=$(printf '' | venturectl -f json forge set-secret "$FORGE" \
         | jq -r '.secret')

# 3. A repository
venturectl create forge_repo name=owner/project forge_id="$FORGE" \
    default_branch=main branch_prefix=venture/ \
    push_issues=true accept_issues=true active=true

# 4. A rule: bugs anywhere on this forge get an agent and a draft PR
venturectl create forge_rule name="Bugs" forge_id="$FORGE" \
    issue_type=bug enabled=true runner=agent outcome=draft_pr \
    trigger=on_create max_runs_per_day=10

# 5. Check what a ticket would resolve to
venturectl list forge_rule forge_id__eq="$FORGE"
```

Rules resolve most-specific-first: repository+type, repository catch-all,
forge+type, forge catch-all, then nothing. **Nothing is a legitimate answer**
— a repository nobody enrolled does not get an AI because a rule elsewhere
was written generously. A disabled rule falls through to a broader one; to
suppress work for one repository, enable a rule with `ai_enabled=false`.

Coding runs are off until `forge.runs_enabled` is true in the configuration.
Everything else works without it.

## Reading output in scripts

Output is a table on a terminal and JSON when piped, so `-f json` is only
needed when you want JSON *and* a terminal.

```bash
venturectl -f json list sale | jq -r '.records[] | "\(.id)\t\(.gross.formatted)"'
venturectl -f json get ticket 1 | jq -r '.title'
venturectl -f json list forge_run state__eq=failed | jq -r '.records[].failure_reason'
```

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | fine |
| 2 | usage |
| 3 | not found |
| 4 | conflict — usually a uniqueness constraint |
| 5 | auth — token missing, wrong, or the wrong role |
| 6 | unsupported |
| 7 | network — the server is not there |
| 8 | validation — the record was refused |
| 1 | anything else |

Branch on these rather than on message text; the messages are written for
people and will change.

## Keeping this accurate

This file is maintained with the code. When a command, a flag, an exit code
or a trap changes, change it here in the same commit — a skill that is
confidently wrong is worse than no skill, because it is followed.

Check it against reality with `venturectl --help` and
`venturectl describe <type>`; those two are generated from the source and
cannot drift.
